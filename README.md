# odin-recipes 
This is my very first web development project, developed as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course after completing the HTML section.

## Project Description

This project is a simple website dedicated to recipes. It serves as a practical application of fundamental HTML concepts, demonstrating my ability to structure web content. The site currently features a main index page that links to individual recipe pages.

## Features

* **Home Page:** An introductory page with links to various recipes.
* **Recipe Pages:** Dedicated pages for each recipe, showcasing ingredients, steps, and images.
* **Basic HTML Structure:** Utilizes headings, paragraphs, ordered lists, unordered lists, images, and internal/external links.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5

## What I Learned

* **Creating Hyperlinks:** Navigating between pages and linking to external resources.
* **Embedding Images:** Including images with proper `alt` attributes.
* **Structuring Lists:** Using `<ul>` and `<ol>` for ingredients and steps.
* **Basic Project Setup:** Organizing files and folders for a web project.
